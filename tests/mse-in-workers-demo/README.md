## Demo description

* Demonstration of how usage of Media Source Extensions API from a dedicated
  worker context can avoid "buffering jank" when the main window context is
  very busy, even though the media element playing the buffered media is still
  on that main thread.
* Presents a side-by-side comparison of two players, one fetching and buffering
  to its media element solely on the main window context, and the other player
  relying on a dynamically created dedicated worker to fetch and buffer the same
  media into a MediaSource owned by that worker's context, attached to the
  main window context's media element via a transferred-to-main
  MediaSourceHandle object set on the media element's srcObject attribute.
* A scenario where the main thread is under heavy contention is achieved by
  frequently busy-waiting on it while both players are fetching, buffering and
  playing. Furthermore, asynchronous appendBuffer operations are performed (on
  each of the main and worker MSE demos) in small chunks to enable rapid
  appearance of "buffering jank" on the player being buffered via MSE on the
  main thread versus a much better experience on the player being buffered via
  MSE on the worker thread, even though the media stream is short.
* In practice, main thread (aka Window context) contention can result from many
  sources, though commonly it is from complex and frequent task execution
  demands made by the application on the Window execution context, and is made
  worse when the platform has less execution capacity available. The DOM and
  associated application javascript operate in the Window execution context.
  DedicatedWorkers run in a concurrent execution context with respect to the
  Window execution context. Even with concurrent buffering and smoother playback
  by using MSE on a dedicated worker context, observe that the video element for
  the MSE-in-Worker player can still have poor controls response time when the
  Window context is under high contention. This is because that element (and its
  controls) can only execute on the Window context and their event handlers can
  have high scheduling latency.

## Usage
* Chrome has MSE-in-Workers enabled by default beginning with version
  108.0.5334.0.
* If using Chrome 105.0.5180.0 through 108.0.5333.0, enable the experimental
  MSE-in-Workers support:
  * with cmdline option enabling the two required features:
    `--enable-blink-features=MediaSourceInWorkers,MediaSourceInWorkersUsingHandle`
    (preferred approach),
  * or enable via `chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features`:
    select `Enabled` and then `Relaunch`. (Warning: this latter option enables
    other experimental features, including `AudioVideoTracks` which is not yet
    supported with `MediaSourceInWorkers` and would cause sad-tab when querying
    a worker SourceBuffer's audioTracks or videoTracks, as could happen if you
    inspect a worker SourceBuffer in this demo using devtools.)
* Clone this repo and host its contents in a sandbox webserver.
* Try the demo by navigating to the `mse-in-workers-demo.html` page on your
  server.

## Test Media
Created `test-5seconds.webm` using the following:

`ffmpeg -f lavfi -i testsrc=duration=5:size=1920x1080:rate=30 test-5seconds.webm`

## Update History

* July 27, 2022: Updated to use transferred `MediaSourceHandle` set on
  `srcObject` for worker `MediaSource` attachment, replacing legacy object URL
  attachment that is no longer supported in specification for Dedicated Worker
  MediaSource object attachments to main thread media elements. Previous
  approach using legacy object URLs for attachment was used by the demo for
  Chromium versions beginning 88.0.4300.0 and ending 105.0.5180.0.
* Aug 2, 2022: Updated to indicate the first Chrome versions having this feature
  enabled by default.
* Sep 9, 2022: Updated to change known-working Chrome versions due to feature
  reverted back to experimental in 105 and 106 due to breaking change (handle
  getter throwing exception in Window context caused old MSE app libs that
  enumerate properties to fail.)
* Sep 21, 2022: Updated to note that the feature in Chrome 107 now also needs
  the experimental flags.
* Oct 3, 2022: Updated to note that the feature is now on-by-default in Chrome
  beginning with 108.0.5334.0.
